# Bayesian-Econometrics
A Bayesian analysis on the effect of right-to-carry law on U.S. robbery rate.

1. Visualized crime data on 50 U.S. states from 1970 to 2018 to discover state heterogeneities in U.S. robbery rate
2. Used a mixed, unpooled and a hierarchical model to estimate the effect of implementing the shall-issue law on robbery rate
3. All three models show that the passing of the law reduces robbery rates in the long run
